          My name is Angelo and I am a young professional in the IT/SaaS world who
          is currently learning how to code. I am most interested in learning
          JavaScript in order to help build out the software stack for the
          company I work for. I am most interested in UI/UX design, product
          management, and planning our product roadmap.<br><br>

          In my personal life, I compete in kick boxing and wrestling. I have
          trained in martial arts and combat sports on and off for the last decade,
          and love competing and contiueing to develop. I also enjoy creating
          and playing life music. I mainly play the guitar and produce hip hop
          music.<br><br>

          I see learning to code as a way to merge my personal creative interests,
          with my technical professional career. I look forward to getting comfortable
          enough with my level of skill in coding to use it as a another creative
          outlet, as well as the next step in my career.
