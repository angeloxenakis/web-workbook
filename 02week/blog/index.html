      <h1>Learning to Code at ACA</h1>
      <p>I'm currently enrolled in ACA's 10 week <strong><em>Intro To Web</em></strong>
        course. We are on week three and so far we have learned about many aspects of
        HMTL and CSS. We've learned about divs, classes, id's, and much more; as well as
        how to select and style those different elements in CSS. I'm looking forward
        to completing thic course and utilizing the skills I learn in my career.</p>

        <h1>My Son</h1>
        <p>I recently had a son about six months ago. His name is Aristedes Xenakis,
        but most people call him Ari. He was born on October 25th, 2017. He has blue
        eyes and drity blonde hair. He is just starting to crawl and make noises
        that sound like words. He's eating solid foods and has two teeth.</p>

        <h1>Thoughts About Moving to Austin</h1>
        <p>My family and I have often talked about the possibility of moving to Austin.
        I've grown up in Houston for most of my life, so I've visited Austin many
        times, but I have never lived there. We've even gone as far as looking at
        houses in the city and looking for jobs in the area. For now, we have a house
        in Houston and solid jobs here so it may not happen immidiately, but eventually
        may end up living in Austin, and maybe I'll finish out school with ACA on
        campus!</p>
